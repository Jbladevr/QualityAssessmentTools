  ##### Subtasks:
  * Update extension to implement PMD.(complete)
  * Implement PMD on the package level. (complete)
  * Update Preferences to include option for user to input directory. (TODO)
  

## Useful information about current delivery

* Updated README.md with detailed instructions, authors, and acknowledgements.


## TODO

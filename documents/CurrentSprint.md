* As a client, I want instructions provided on how to use the extension.<br /> 

* As a client, I want to be able to see Sprint.md, which will show what was implemented at the last delivery.<br />

* As a client, I want to be able to find what licences are used for the project.<br />

* As a client, I want to be able to see every delivery ever made.<br />

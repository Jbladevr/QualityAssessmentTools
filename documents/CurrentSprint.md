## FifthDelivery Sprint

* As a user, I want my program to be run through PMD/CPD using the Quality Assessment Tools extension.<br />
  ##### Subtasks:
  * Refactor so the extension has QualityAssessmentTools structure and not Checkstyle. 
  * Update Preferences to include option for user to input directory.
  * Analyze SpotBugs tool.
* As a developer, I want QualityAssessmentTools extension to produce "under development" window for the tools that are not implemented yet in the cascading menu.
